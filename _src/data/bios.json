    "description": "Karina's work began at an early age, having grown up in Guatemala, she learned to sew by deconstructing her clothes to see how they were made. As a stay at home mom living in Portland, she began making skirts for her three little girls as well as her friends, and soon began receiving custom orders. Her hobby quickly turned into a business that is sold in stores around Portland and the United States. Her designs are inspired by beauty, comfort and simplicity."
